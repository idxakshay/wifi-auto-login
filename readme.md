</details>

### 2. First-Time Setup

1. Double-click the `wifi-login.bat` script to run it
2. When prompted, enter your:
   - Username (your 91springboard login email)
   - Password (your 91springboard password)
3. The script will automatically:
   - Save your credentials securely
   - Request administrative privileges to set up auto-start
   - Create a scheduled task for automatic login

### 3. Automatic Login

After the initial setup, the script will:

- Run automatically when you log into Windows
- Connect to the 91springboard WiFi network
- Handle the portal authentication automatically

## How It Works

The script performs several automated tasks:

1. **Credential Management**

   - Stores credentials securely in `%USERPROFILE%\.sbc\credentials.txt`
   - Uses these saved credentials for subsequent logins

2. **Network Connection**

   - Automatically connects to the "91springboard" WiFi network
   - Waits for the connection to stabilize

3. **Portal Authentication**

   - Performs automatic login to the portal using saved credentials
   - Uses CURL to handle the authentication request

4. **Auto-Start Configuration**
   - Creates a Windows scheduled task to run on system logon
   - Ensures the script runs with necessary permissions

## Troubleshooting

If you need to update your credentials:

1. Delete the folder: `%USERPROFILE%\.sbc`
2. Run the script again to re-enter your credentials

## Security Note

Your credentials are stored locally on your computer in plain text. While this is convenient, please be aware of the security implications.
